HTML to Text component for React (Native)

## What is it for?
Main problem we've faced during development was how unreliable WebView was in Android and iOS. In a matter of fact it was slow and on Android - unusable, due to no way we could measure content height properly.

This tiny piece of code takes your simple html documents and converts into native React (Native) components. To be honest - it was tested on React Native only, so i have no idea wether it's of any use for web guys.

It was written in about 2 hours. Can it be prettier? Sure. Does it fit our needs? 100%. Feel free to contribute.

## How does it work?
